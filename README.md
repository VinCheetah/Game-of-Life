# Game of Life

Welcome to the Game of Life! This is a Python implementation of the famous cellular automaton devised by the mathematician John Conway. The Game of Life is a zero-player game that simulates the evolution of cells in a grid based on a set of simple rules. This README file will guide you through the setup and usage of this project.

## Installation

1. Ensure that you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2. Clone the project repository from GitHub or download it manually:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/game-of-life.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd game-of-life
   ```


## Usage

To run the Game of Life simulation, you need to execute the `gol_final.py` file. You can do this by running the following command:

```
python gol_final.py
```

Once the simulation starts, you will see a graphical window displaying a grid of cells. The cells will evolve over time according to the rules of the Game of Life.

If you want to run the previous version of the project you need to execute `main.py` file. You can do this by running the following command:

```
python main.py
```


### Controls

Find all the controls in the manuel that you can access after running the code

## Contributing

If you wish to contribute to this project, you can follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Make your desired changes to the codebase.
3. Write tests to ensure the functionality is not compromised (if applicable).
4. Submit a pull request, explaining the changes you have made.

Your contributions are greatly appreciated!

## License

You are free to use, modify, and distribute the code for both commercial and non-commercial purposes.

## Acknowledgments

This implementation of the Game of Life is based on the original rules and concepts developed by John Conway. The code structure and project setup were inspired by various open-source projects and tutorials available online.
Some predefined patterns with amazing properties are saved and can be placed by pressing a number.
The corallien version of the game of life is a different version where a dead cell become a skeleton which is considered as alive by its neighbours.
You can relatively easily implement your own rules in the game, by creating a new son class of Game and one for Cell.
Have Fun !
